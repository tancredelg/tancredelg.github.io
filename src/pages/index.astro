                    Hello! I'm TancrÃ¨de, a computer scientist and robotics engineer-in-training.
                    I've always been captivated by the process of turning complex ideas into
                    tangible reality, a passion that took me from a First-Class Honours CS degree at
                    McGill to my current MSc in Robotics at EPFL, where I'm focused on building the
                    brains behind intelligent machines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From programming autonomous robots to creating practical, robust web apps, or
                    spending sleepless nights designing and developing games, I'm blending technical
                    skill with creative expression in all kinds of projects. And when I'm not
                    building, I'm learning. You'll find me lost in the trenches of AI/ML research,
                    exploring novel open-source projects, or binging the latest talks, blogs &
                    videos on everything from control theory to systems design - chasing my
                    curiosity down any rabbit hole I can find to stay on the cutting edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to build resilient, impactful systems, whether they're navigating the
                    physical world or processing massive datasets. Looking ahead, I am eager to
                    translate my academic background into industry experience and am actively
                    seeking a challenging 6-month internship beginning in late summer or fall 2026.
                    I'm particularly excited by opportunities in ML engineering, robotics, and
                    applied AI research. I'm always eager to connect with others who share a
                    fascination for this fast-moving field. Whether you want to discuss the latest
                    research, exchange ideas, or just say hi, please feel free to reach out and
                    start a conversation.
